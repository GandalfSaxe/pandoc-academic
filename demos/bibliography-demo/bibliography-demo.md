# Abstract

Pizza [@pizza2000identification] is an understudied yet widely utilized implement for delivering in-vivo *Solanum lycopersicum* based liquid mediums in a variety of next-generation mastications studies. Here we describe a de novo approach for large scale *T. aestivum* assemblies based on protein folding that drastically reduces the generation time of the mutation rate.

# Algorithm

$$f(x)=pizza^2$$

# NES for Orbital Mechanics

And now for something completely different: Using evolution strategies [@Salimans2017] for finding low energy transfer orbits. Cool right This section was just to make a second reference.
